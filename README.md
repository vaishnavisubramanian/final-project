## What is Pola ?
Pola is a website where you can book your bus tickets online.
## Why is Pola ?
Pola makes it easier for customers to book tickets online with ease, they can pick any seat of their comfort, they can avail multiple offers. Technically the cost of tickets will be lower while comparing to buying tickets in-person.
## Why did I choose this project ?
Whenever I was travelling before, I felt uncomfortable with my seat and it was a whole waste of money. So I planned to create a website on my own where I can book seats of my choice in my favourite buses. I don't have to stand in a queue to get a ticket, sitting at one place I can book tickets.
